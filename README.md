Headlight: Central Mining Drove API Implementation

My decision to use NodeJS/Express happens to be a little bias. Since working with Web Development for several years, I find it extremely flexible. Since there are many ways of doing anything. Getting something like a CRUD Application up in running would be relatively straightforward. This can also lead to several approaches not working properly since depending on the environments your working in or even length of understanding can lead to precious time wasted. 

This is why i used ExpressJS build my Restful API POSTMAN to test my HTTP Requests and ramdaJS to introduce a more future proof flavor that focuses on purer functions and never mutating user data. It is a new approach in the javascript world and I have been a stalwart for trying to championing this new approach.

Although I did not finish this I new from the start that trying to complete this from scratch in as little as 4 hours would be rather challenging in a sense that I do not really work with Go Language and integrating it into my local environment took about 20-30mins. Since I had to update several packages in my zsh shell (oh-my-zsh seems to install go in a different place then the area I was told to do on their official Site)

reviewing all the documentation after took about an hour. Then creating this documentation took another 30 mins.

Approach on building out the API will be sort of like this:
Creating a Folder and a package.json file with the necessary dependencies.
installing and starting with a simple server.js file ( I named mind webusaaba.js)
Then Getting a simple server running
adding a dev and start scripts
Create my first test routes GET,POST
then testing to make sure I am getting a successful response.
Implementation of /register ROUTE.
Testing ROUTE in postman
 <------ At this point I needed to stop but to let you know what my thought process will be is.
Implementation of /Move ROUTE
Testing of /Move Route
Implementation of /Scan Route

<---- At this point I would like to create a visual implementation that would be something like a Drone ( or a big square box ...lol) that would move across a grid. This would be another new thing for me so I would check Github for any projects that would do something like this. Being able to see my code actually slowly grow and take shape would be good for my morale and motivation. Coding with only a mental model has its limits sometimes.

Once I would have all the routes completed  I  would start separating the server Code into modules..

whoops I am out of time it seems.






I did a bit of research on building a ExpressJS with the latest tools which include the links below:
